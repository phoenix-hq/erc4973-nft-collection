# What are ERC4973 tokens?

ERC4973 is a [token standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4973) for non-transferrable NFTs, also known as account-bound tokens (ABTs) or soulbound tokens. In other words, ABT is a NFT bound to a single account (wallet) and cannot be transferred between accounts (wallets).

# Why ERC4973 tokens?

NFT projects and DAOs can use ERC4973 tokens to:

1. track an individual's achievements or credentials
2. award loot or badges
3. gift tokens to social media influencers or celebrities

# What are ABT collections?

An ABT collection is a smart contract, backwards compatible with NFTs, which features:

1. minting (backward compatible with NFTs) ABTs
2. gifting ABTs
3. tracking ABTs
